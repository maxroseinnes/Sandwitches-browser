In a 3d object:
    polys:
        3 individual points for every poly
        3 individual point colors for every point
    
    normals:
        1 for every poly

    colors:
        1 for every poly


To make a poly:
    option 1: give it 3 raw positions and it makes points on it's own

    option 2: make three point objects and feed it the three points
