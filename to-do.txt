why are normals changing with smooth sandwitch? -- solved: non-smooth interpolation was in affect



Point and poly organization:
    have each object occupy a domain of the webgl. point and poly arrays
    this 


sub in points and reorganize points and polys at a fixed rate


Movement:
    Make movementState variable in Player class
        still
        walking
        sprinting (smaller hitbox)
        sliding (smaller hitbox)

send client TPS in player data


drawing transparent stuff:
    idea: make second canvas on top for transparent stuff


make smoothPosition method for PhysicalObject class


move gloss and shadowable values to models

Collision:
    - for each collision:
        - do normal box collision + check if boxes are currently colliding:
            - if (!colliding && !currently colliding) RETURN
            - if (colliding && currently colliding): do GPU collision
            - if (colliding && !currently colliding): correct position to box collider (as it is doing now)
