why are normals changing with smooth sandwitch? -- solved: non-smooth interpolation was in affect



Point and poly organization:
    have each object occupy a domain of the webgl. point and poly arrays
    this 


sub in points and reorganize points and polys at a fixed rate


Movement:
    Make movementState variable in Player class
        still
        walking
        sprinting (smaller hitbox)
        sliding (smaller hitbox)

send client TPS in player data


drawing transparent stuff:
    idea: make second canvas on top for transparent stuff


make smoothPosition method for PhysicalObject class


move gloss and shadowable values to models

Collision:
    - for each collision:
        - do normal box collision + check if boxes are currently colliding:
            - if (!colliding && !currently colliding) RETURN
            - if (colliding && currently colliding): do GPU collision
            - if (colliding && !currently colliding): correct position to box collider (as it is doing now)


Outline pipeline (in chosen resolution)
    render depth map
    render surface normals
        (maybe do both of these in one draw call?)
    

make messages only be able to affect player sending them


charge handling:
Start charging 
-> send "startedCharging" 
-> server records startChargeTime and flips charging to true 
-> send "newWeapon" 
-> if (charging) shoot weapon with Math.max((Date.now() - startChargeTime) / chargeTime, 1) strength
- charging gets set to false if:
    - current weapon is changed,
    - "stoppedCharging" is sent
    - "newWeapon" is sent
- charging can only be set to true when startChargeTime is set to Date.now()
